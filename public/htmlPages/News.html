                Detailed international research underscores fragile condition of famous painting.

            <p>
                Research conducted at the Van Gogh Museum into Vincent van Gogh’s famous
                Sunflowers has produced a great deal of new information regarding the
                condition of the painting and the materials that Van Gogh used.
                One of the conclusions is that the painting is stable, but fragile.
                Axel Rüger, Director of the Van Gogh Museum:
                ‘This is why we have decided that Sunflowers will no longer travel away
                from the museum. From now on, this highlight of our collection will
                stay at home in Amsterdam, available for all of our visitors to see
                every day of the year’.

                A photograph that was long thought to be of the 13-year-old Vincent van Gogh has now been proven to be a portrait of his brother
                Theo van Gogh, aged 15.
            </b>

            <p>
                This is the conclusion after new, in-depth research conducted by
                the Van Gogh Museum and Yves Vasseur (General Commissioner of
                Mons 2015 European Capital of Culture).
                Forensic examination has confirmed the misidentification.
